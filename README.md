# EDSS_module_4
Here is the code for creating an image classification model using machine learning! This was created as a team effort by Rebecca Salcedo, Carmen Le, Jeremiah Ets-Hokin, and Saul Gamboa. The code is a collaborative effort between us, Dr. Ilmi Yoon and Dr. Pleuni Pennigs from San Francisco State University, https://twitter.com/Ana_Caballero_H, and researchers at Oxford who wrote the original VGG16 image classification model (https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556). Check out our blog post where we talk about the process of creating this model and how ML can be used in biology research!


We split the project into two parts: splitting the images into training/test/validation folders and then actually creating and training the model.
The first step is in the split_images_TrainTestValidation.ipynb
The second is in the create_model_Dogs_NoDogs.ipynb

Sometimes github has trouble displaying ipynb notebooks, if that happens you should be able to see the code by viewing the "raw blob" or you can try to open the file in google co-lab!
Here's a link to a blogpost I found helpful: https://medium.com/@pg170898/problem-facing-at-github-ipynb-is-not-loading-f986a04649f3

Here is a link to a google drive folder with the images we used to train the model:
